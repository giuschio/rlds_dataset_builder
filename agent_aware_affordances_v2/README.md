### Short description
The dataset consists of end-effector trajectories executed by a mobile manipulator with the task or opening or closing an oven. 
### Episodes
At the beginning of each episode, a partial point cloud is collected of the target object from the point of view of the agent. The agent then plans and executes a trajectory. The open/close task executed in a non-prehensile manner, therefore the robot gripper remains open throughout the entire interaction. No further images/pointclouds are collected during the episode.
### Preprocessing
The point cloud is not processed.
